# DragonManager
###### Create and manage your DND Characters within an application!

## How to use:
All you should need to do is unzip the .zip for your operating system, and run the application inside! If you have an issue, [create one](https://github.com/RealHypnoticOcelot/DragonManager/issues/new) on GitHub so I can fix it.

### Current Feature List:

- Create, load and save characters as .json

- Set a custom background for the window, with three different scaling options

- Change program theme - much of the UI is still incomplete

## How to build:

If you're interested in building, you should import this as a Maven project and just run `mvn clean package` after setting the `<jdkPath>` to the path of your JDK in `pom.xml`.

More info on JavaPackager, the tool I use to create native executables, is available [here](https://github.com/fvarrui/JavaPackager). I haven't tested building this before on another computer, so I'm not sure I've included everything required. If this is the case, [create an issue](https://github.com/RealHypnoticOcelot/DragonManager/issues/new) so that I can include anything necessary.
