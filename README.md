# DragonManager
###### Create and manage your DND Characters within an application!

## How to use:
All you should need to do is unzip the .zip for your operating system, and run the application inside! If you have an issue, [create one](https://github.com/RealHypnoticOcelot/DragonManager/issues/new) on GitHub so I can fix it.

## Current Feature List:

- Create, load and save characters as .json

- Set a custom background for the window, with three different scaling options

- Change program theme - much of the ui is still incomplete
